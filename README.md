# Overview

In this project, I am trying to grow my familiarity with backend webb development. I learned how to set up a web app.

This Web App is a simple board game website that encourages people to learn new board games and to expand their board gaming group. I included a board game database in the web app to help people find new games.

Here is a software demo video.

# Web Pages

I created 3 web pages: a home page, a group finding page and a page that contains a list of board games.

# Development Environment

I used the Django web framework, operating out of VS code.
